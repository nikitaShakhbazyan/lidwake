/// Keeps the Mac awake while an agent is working.
///
/// A thin helper-side wrapper around `SleepBlockPolicy` (in LidwakeKit, where the
/// compose/idempotence/crash-recovery logic is unit-tested). This file owns only the two real
/// mechanisms behind the policy's seams:
///
/// 1. **Idle system sleep** — a standard, reference-counted `IOPMAssertion`
///    (`kIOPMAssertPreventUserIdleSystemSleep`). The kernel releases it automatically if this
///    process dies, and it shows in `pmset -g assertions` so the user can see Lidwake is active.
///    It does *not*, by its own header, survive a lid close.
/// 2. **Clamshell (lid-closed) sleep** — the global **`SleepDisabled`** power setting, applied via
///    `pmset -a disablesleep 1`.
///
/// > **Why shell out to `pmset` rather than an in-process IOKit call?** Three cleaner mechanisms
/// > were each tried on a real device (macOS 26.3) and **none keep a displayless lid-closed Mac
/// > awake**:
/// > 1. Private `RootDomainUserClient` selector 12 (`kPMSetClamshellSleepState` →
/// >    `setClamShellSleepDisable`) — returns `kIOReturnSuccess`, Mac still sleeps (governs the
/// >    *external-display* clamshell-mode path, not no-display lid-close).
/// > 2. `IORegistryEntrySetCFProperty(IOPMrootDomain, "SleepDisabled", …)` — returns
/// >    `kIOReturnNotPermitted` (0xE00002E2) even as root.
/// > 3. `IOPMSetSystemPowerSetting("SleepDisabled", CFNumber(1))` (the call `pmset`'s disablesleep
/// >    path makes per-key, bound via `@_silgen_name`) — returns `kIOReturnSuccess`, `pmset -g`
/// >    still reports `SleepDisabled 0`, and the Mac **sleeps on lid close**. `pmset` does more
/// >    than this single call: it coordinates `IOPMSetPMPreferences` + activation around it.
/// >
/// > Replicating `pmset`'s full sequence in-process is fragile; `/usr/bin/pmset` is Apple's tested
/// > implementation and runs only on rare block-state flips, so the subprocess cost is a non-issue.
///
/// `disablesleep` is **not** cleared on crash and can reset across a sleep/wake cycle, so the
/// policy clears it on construction (crash recovery) and again on release, and the daemon
/// re-applies the blocked state on wake (see `SystemPowerMonitor`).
///
/// **One shared instance per process.** The sleep-blocking state is machine-global — the wrong
/// thing to scope per XPC connection. `HelperListenerDelegate` owns a single `SleepBlocker` and
/// hands the *same* instance to every `HelperXPCService`, so a daemon reconnect (restart or XPC
/// interruption) reuses the existing assertion instead of minting a fresh one and orphaning the
/// old (a leaked `IOPMAssertion` the kernel only reclaims on process death). Because it's now
/// shared across connections, the policy it guards lives inside an `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` (which
/// is `Sendable` and owns its protected state), so the blocker is internally synchronized — it no
/// longer relies on each `HelperXPCService` holding a per-instance lock (which wouldn't serialize
