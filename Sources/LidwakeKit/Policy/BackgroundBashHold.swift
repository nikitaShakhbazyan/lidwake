/// Policy for the opt-in *background-shell* keep-awake (Part 2). Part 1 covers agents and
/// sub-agents whose work brackets a hook pair; the remaining gap is a shell command an agent launches
/// with `run_in_background: true` (Claude Code's Bash tool). Such a command keeps running after the
/// turn's `Stop`, and **neither the parent nor any sub-agent fires a completion hook for it** — so
/// there is no symmetric release, only the `PreToolUse` that starts it.
///
/// Two consequences shape this design:
///
///   - **TTL-bounded, not idle-released.** With no end hook, the hold can only be released by a
///     deadline. The daemon's CPU-idle net won't do it either: while the agent keeps serving other
///     turns its process tree isn't idle, so the hold would linger indefinitely. Hence a TTL —
///     `requestedTTL` (the installed hook passes `--ttl <ceiling>`), else `defaultTTLSeconds` — which
///     the daemon further clamps to the live `manualHoldMaxHours` (`ManualHold.clampExpiry`). The
///     installed command deliberately requests the ceiling so the *effective* TTL always tracks the
///     user's configured max-hold, rather than a value baked in at install time that drifts when they
///     change the cap.
///   - **Per-invocation key.** Each background command holds independently (`bg-<uniqueID>` in the
///     session slot of `<tool>:<key>`), so two overlapping background tasks don't share — and thus
///     can't prematurely release — one another's hold.
///
/// This type is the pure, testable decision; the `acquire --if-background` CLI command reads the
/// stdin payload and the owning PID around it, and the daemon applies and caps the resulting hold.
///
/// **Claude Code only.** Codex has no equivalent clean pre-tool boolean: its shell tool uses an
/// `exec_command`/`write_stdin` PTY model with a `yield_time_ms` background yield, not a single
/// `run_in_background` flag on one tool call, so there's no reliable `PreToolUse` signal to key on.
/// Codex background-shell keep-awake is a follow-up; the shape is installed only for Claude Code.
