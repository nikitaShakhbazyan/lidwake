///
/// The waiting signal is `ClaudeSessionStatus` (the session's own status file); the policy is the
/// user's `AgentWaitingPolicy`. The evaluator is the pure, unit-tested core in the style of
/// `IdleReleaseEvaluator`: it holds the cross-sweep bookkeeping (which holds are parked, and what
/// their expiry looked like before), while `SessionStatusMonitor` supplies the real file reads,
/// process probes, and the timer, and the daemon executes the returned actions.
///
/// A *parked* hold is one this evaluator acted on for a wait that hasn't resolved: under `.grace`
/// it carries a grace TTL (and may since have been released by TTL expiry); under `.sleep` it was
/// released outright. Parking is remembered so the moment the session turns busy again — answered
/// at the keyboard, from a phone, or auto-continued by a timeout — the hold is restored or
/// re-acquired, protecting the resumed turn that no hook announces.
