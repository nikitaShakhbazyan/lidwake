/// Pure extraction of the identity fields Lidwake keys holds on out of a hook's stdin JSON payload.
///
/// Every Claude-Code-style hook system (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor) invokes the hook
/// command with a JSON object on stdin. Two fields matter to us:
///
///   - `session_id` — the parent session/turn id, present on every hook. `UserPromptSubmit`/`Stop`
///     key their per-turn hold on it.
///   - `agent_id` — a **sub-agent's own** id, present only on `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop`. The
///     parent's `session_id` is *also* on those payloads, so a sub-agent hook that keyed on
///     `session_id` would collide with — and, being idempotent-by-key, wrongly release — the
///     parent's turn hold. Keying the sub-agent hold on `agent_id` gives it a distinct key that
///     survives the parent `Stop` and releases only on its own `SubagentStop`.
///
/// Verified against both agents' source: Claude Code (`src/utils/hooks.ts`, `SubagentStart`/
/// `SubagentStop` set `agent_id` while `createBaseHookInput` fills `session_id` with the *main*
/// session) and Codex/codex-rs (`hooks/src/schema.rs` `Subagent*CommandInput` carry `agent_id`
/// alongside `session_id`, from `thread_id()` vs the shared root `session_id()`). Both name the
/// field identically, so a single `agent_id` read covers Claude Code and Codex.
///
/// This is the pure, testable core; `CLIStdin` reads the bytes off stdin and delegates here.
