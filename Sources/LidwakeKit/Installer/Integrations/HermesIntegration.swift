/// Hermes (NousResearch/hermes-agent): a **shell hook** declared in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` under a
/// `hooks:` map, plus an approval in `~/.hermes/shell-hooks-allowlist.json`.
///
/// Verified against an installed Hermes on a real device: of its three hook systems, shell hooks
/// are the right fit — declared in `config.yaml`, they run in both CLI and Gateway and pipe a JSON
/// payload to the command's **stdin**. The command must be allowlisted (first-use consent), matched
/// by exact (event, command); without it the hooks are silently skipped. Its other two hook systems
/// — Python plugins and the gateway-only `HOOK.yaml` — don't fit.
///
/// Hermes is a 24/7 **gateway**: one shared process multiplexes every session, and its session hooks
/// are asymmetric — `on_session_start` fires once per new conversation (not on continuation) while
/// `on_session_end` fires at the end of *every* turn. So the naive start→acquire / end→release pair
/// under-protects multi-turn sessions (only the first turn gets a hold). We instead treat the gateway
/// as a single activity unit (`AgentKind.isGatewayScoped`): acquire on both `on_session_start` *and*
/// `pre_gateway_dispatch` (the latter fires once per incoming message, so a turn arriving after the
/// hold was released is re-protected), coalesced onto a fixed `hermes:gateway` hold carrying the
/// gateway PID. Release on `on_session_end` is the fast path back to sleep; the daemon's CPU-idle and
/// dead-process nets on the gateway tree are what actually make a missed/asymmetric end hook safe.
///
/// YAML is mutated with line-scoped string surgery, never a parse/serialize round-trip (which would
/// reorder and reformat the user's whole file). Every removal is recognizer-based so user content
/// survives even a damaged marker block.
