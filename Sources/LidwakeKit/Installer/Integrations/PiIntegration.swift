    /// including idle time at the prompt, and — since the only `acquire` was at t=0 — an idle release
    /// left the rest of the session unprotected with nothing to re-acquire. Re-acquiring per turn is
    /// safe because `acquire` is idempotent per key. (.)

    /// `stdio: "ignore"` matters now that the safety-net release is routinely a no-op: `execFileSync`
    /// inherits stderr by default, so `release`'s "released nothing" would print into the TUI.

    /// hold used to sit with `pid=-1`, unreachable by the dead-process and CPU-idle nets; a missed
    /// `agent_settled` then leaked until the 24h backstop. Extensions load in-process (jiti import),

    /// missed-everything case, refreshed on each `agent_start` like the Cursor integration's.
