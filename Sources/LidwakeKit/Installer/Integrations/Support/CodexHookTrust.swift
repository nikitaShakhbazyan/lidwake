/// Codex won't run a command hook until it's trusted: the user approves it in the TUI via `/hooks`,
/// and Codex records the approval in `~/.codex/config.toml` as a table
/// `[hooks.state."<hooks.json path>:<event>:<group>:<handler>"]` carrying a `trusted_hash` (event
/// labels are snake_case there — `user_prompt_submit`, `stop` — even though the `hooks.json` keys are
/// CamelCase). We detect that a `trusted_hash` is recorded for our handlers rather than recomputing
/// Codex's hash: the hash is taken over Codex's *internal* normalized handler identity, so reproducing
/// it would couple us to Codex internals and break on an upgrade. Since the installer keeps our command
/// byte-stable — which is exactly what keeps an existing `trusted_hash` valid — a recorded hash on our
/// key is a reliable "trusted" signal.
///
/// This is guidance, never a gate. A false `untrusted` just re-shows the instructions; a false
/// `trusted` at worst lets a still-untrusted hook fail quietly until the user sees Codex prompt them.
/// Returns `.unknown` when `hooks.json` isn't installed or `config.toml` is absent/unreadable.
