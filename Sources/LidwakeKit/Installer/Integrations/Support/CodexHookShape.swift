/// Codex's `hooks.json` format (verified on-device against npm `@openai/codex` and the official
/// `figma` marketplace plugin's own `hooks.json`): each event maps to an array of **matcher
/// groups**, and each group wraps an inner `hooks` array of `{ "type": "command", "command": … }`
/// handlers — the *same* nested shape Claude Code uses.
///
/// ```json
/// { "hooks": { "UserPromptSubmit": [ { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "lidwake acquire …" } ] } ],
///              "Stop":            [ { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "lidwake release …" } ] } ] } }
/// ```
///
/// > An earlier note claimed Codex used a *flat* `[{ "type": "command", … }]` array (no group
/// > wrapper). That was wrong: it silently ignores the flat form — `/hooks` lists nothing — and
/// > the nested matcher-group shape above is what it actually parses. `matcher` is omitted here: it
/// > narrows *which tool* a Pre/PostToolUse hook fires for, and these lifecycle events have no tool.
///
/// **Acquire on `UserPromptSubmit`, release on `Stop`.** Codex's `Stop` hook fires at turn
/// completion — the model is done and control returns to the user (`run_turn_stop_hooks` runs when
/// `!needs_follow_up`; verified in codex-rs `session/turn.rs`). Bracketing each turn with
/// acquire→release mirrors Claude Code exactly: the Mac is kept awake only while a turn is running,
/// and the next `UserPromptSubmit` re-acquires. `Stop` carries `session_id` on stdin (the same field
/// acquire keys on), so the release targets the exact `<tool>:<session_id>` hold. An Esc-interrupt is
/// the one turn-end that skips `Stop` (the abort short-circuits it) — covered, as for Claude, by the
/// daemon's CPU-idle sweep and process-exit watcher. A prior version released only via those nets and
/// missed turn-end entirely, leaving a hold pinned until the 24h backstop on installs whose process
/// the daemon couldn't watch (e.g. Homebrew's triple-suffixed binary name).
///
/// Two Codex-specific constraints shape this type:
///
/// 1. **No marker key.** Codex deserializes handlers strictly, so an extra `_lidwake` field risks an
///    "unexpected key" rejection (the figma example carries only `type`+`command`). We identify our
///    own handlers by their `command` containing `lidwake` instead of tagging them.
/// 2. **Preserve trust.** Trust is *not* stored in `hooks.json` — when the user trusts our hooks via
///    `/hooks`, Codex records `[hooks.state."<path>:<event>:<group>:<handler>"] trusted_hash = …` in
///    `config.toml`, keyed per handler by its position **and** a hash of its command. So re-installing
///    must keep each handler at a stable index with an unchanged command, or the key/hash no longer
///    matches and the user must re-approve. We therefore leave a correct handler untouched (preserving
///    any sibling keys), only rewrite one whose command drifted, and append a fresh group when absent.
///    Each event is trusted independently, so adding the `Stop` handler asks the user to trust only
///    that new handler — the existing `UserPromptSubmit` trust is untouched.
