    ///     records query-completion runs on interrupt too), so releasing on it frees the Mac shortly
    ///     after an interrupted turn.
    ///   - `SubagentStart` (acquire) / `SubagentStop` (release), each carrying the `--subagent`
    ///     command so the hold is keyed on the sub-agent's own `agent_id` and outlives the parent
    ///     turn's `Stop` — the fix for backgrounded sub-agents sleeping the Mac mid-work.
