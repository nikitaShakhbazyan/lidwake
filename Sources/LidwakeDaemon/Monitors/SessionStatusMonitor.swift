/// Watches Claude Code's session status files (`~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`) so a session that
/// has stopped mid-turn to wait for the user — a question, a plan approval, a permission prompt —
/// is handled by the user's `AgentWaitingPolicy` instead of standing until the CPU-idle sweep
///. See `ClaudeSessionStatus` for the file, `SessionWaitEvaluator` for the decisions;
/// this supplies the file reads, the process probe, and the timer, and hands actions to the daemon.
///
/// Polling, not file watching, on purpose: Claude Code rewrites the files in place (no rename), so
/// a directory kqueue never fires for status flips — and the poll is gated exactly like the other
/// monitors: it runs while an assertion is held (`isBlocking`), plus while a parked wait is
/// outstanding (a hold this policy released must still see its session turn busy again). With
/// nothing held and nothing parked there is no timer and no wakeups.
