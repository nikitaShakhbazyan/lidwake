/// The daemon-owned display assertion for display-class holds (`Assertion.holdsDisplay`).
///
/// Lives in the daemon, not the privileged helper: `PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep` needs no root,
/// and the helper's root surface stays minimal — nothing is added to it that doesn't require it.
/// The assertion is idempotent to set, released on deinit, and kernel-reclaimed if the daemon
/// crashes, so a stale display hold cannot outlive its process.
///
/// Holding is not enough on its own: an IOPM assertion only prevents *future* display sleep. If
/// the panel is already dark when the hold is raised, the agent behind it stays blind — when the
/// display sleeps, every app's accessibility tree collapses to the bare application element — so
/// `set(held: true)` also wakes the display via `IOPMAssertionDeclareUserActivity`, the one call
/// that actually relights it (`caffeinate -d` does not). The returned assertion id is reused
/// across wakes per the IOPMLib contract.
